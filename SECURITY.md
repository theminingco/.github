# Security Bounty Program

**The security bounty is currently paused while ⛏ The Mining Company is still in alpha**

⛏ The Mining Company believes in better security through openness. We welcome and value technical reports of vulnerabilities that could substantially affect the confidentiality or integrity of our services. If you believe that you have discovered such a vulnerability, please report it through a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/theminingco/.github/security/advisories/new). The ⛏ The Mining Company team will work with you to investigate and resolve the issue. The first reporter of a security vulnerability is elligable to receive a monetary reward.

## Eligibility
The ⛏ The Mining Company Security Bounty Program covers anything contained in this repository. Development environments and third-party services are not included in the security bounty program. We are mainly interested in vulnerabilities that would allow attackers to extract private information or degrade the experience for genuine users. We are interested in real vulnerabilites, not in output of automated scanners or tools. We require all vulnerability reports to be accompanied by a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the vulnerabilty and the implications.

### Examples
Below are some examples of in-scope vulnerabilities.
* User impersonation
* Extraction of keys, secrets or tokens
* Sensitive information leaks
* Degradation of service
* Remote code execution

### Out-of-scope examples
Below are some examples of out-of-scope vulnerabilities. If you feel any for the following items pose a real threat to ⛏ The Mining Company feel free to send us a report accompanied with a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the vulnerability.
* Lack of CSRF tokens
* Clickjacking and tabnagging issues
* Missing security headers
* Missing best practices
* Reports from automated tools or scans
* Reports of insecure ciphers
* Absence of rate limiting
* Outdated software
* Broken links

## Responsible disclosure policy
At ⛏ The Mining Company we believe vulnerability disclosure is the right approach to protect our users. When submitting a vulnerability report we ask you to not share any information about the vulnerability with other parties and/or the general public until ⛏ The Mining Company has investigated, resolved and disclosed the issue through a security advisory.

In return, ⛏ The Mining Company commits that security researchers reporting issues and vulnerabilities will be protected from legal liability, so long as they follow the disclosure guidelines and principles as outlined by this document.

## Guidelines
In identifying potential vulnerabilities, we ask that all security researchers stick to the following principles.

When testing, we ask you to:
* Always use your own accounts, funds, information, etc. when researching vulnerabilities.
* Use the lowest amount of funds possible as lost funds cannot always be recovered.

Do not engage in testing that:
* Degrades ⛏ The Mining Company’s information systems and products for other users.
* Results in you, or any third party, accessing, storing, sharing or destroying ⛏ The Mining Company or user data
* May impact ⛏ The Mining Company users, such as denial of service, social engineering or spam.

## Submission Process
Submission reports should include a detailed description of your discovery with clear, concise steps allowing us to reproduce the issue, and should contain a working proof-of-concept.

All reports should go through a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/theminingco/.github/security/advisories/new) unless instructed otherwise by ⛏ The Mining Company.

Low quality reports, such as those that include inadequate information to investigate, may incur significant delays in the disclosure process, which is in nobody’s interest. Please only submit one report per issue.

When submitting a vulnerability report you agree that you may not publicly disclose your findings or the contents of your submission to any third parties in any way without ⛏ The Mining Company's prior written approval.

## Remediation & Disclosure
After triage, we will send a quick acknowledgement and commit to being as transparent as possible about the remediation timeline as well as on issues or challenges that may extend it. You may receive updates with significant events such as the validation of the vulnerability, requests for additional information or your qualification for a reward.

Bug reporters allow ⛏ The Mining Company the opportunity to diagnose and offer fully tested updates, workarounds, or other corrective measures before any party discloses detailed vulnerability or exploit information to the public.

Once the security issue is fixed or mitigated, the ⛏ The Mining Company team will contact you. Prior to any public announcement of a vulnerability, and to the extent permitted by the law, we will share the draft description of the vulnerability with you. In case of disagreement.

## Reward
You may be eligible to receive a reward if:

* You are the first person to submit a given vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is determined to be a valid security issue by the ⛏ The Mining Company.
* You have complied with the ⛏ The Mining Company Security Bounty Program policy and guidelines.

The decision to grant a reward for the discovery of a valid security issue is at ⛏ The Mining Company's sole discretion. The amount of each bounty is based on the classification and sensitivity of the data impacted, the completeness of your Submission report, ease of exploit and overall risk for ⛏ The Mining Company's users and brand.

Bounties will be paid directly to the researcher using either BTC, ETH or USDT.

You will be responsible for any tax implications related to bounty payments you receive, as determined by the laws of your jurisdiction of residence or citizenship.

To be eligible for a reward, you must not:

* Be a resident of, or make your vulnerability submission from, a country against which the Netherlands has issued export sanctions or other trade restrictions.
* Be in violation of any national, state, or local law or regulation.
* Be employed by ⛏ The Mining Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates.
* Be an immediate family member of a person employed by ⛏ The Mining Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates.
